## Introduction

- this project is focusing on finding a new way to solve the traffic problem using machine learning and computer vision
- will mention some problems in traffic and how will be solved in this project
- And future work to make it more efficient and reliable

## Tools used for the project

- OpenCV
- Python programing language
- Visual studio code
- Pycharm

## Traffic problems

### when and where the traffic will happen

It is hard to know where the traffic will happen and when Because if we know when and where the traffic jams we can act accordingly And it need to be fast and accurate to revent the traffic jam before it happens

### What is the reason of the traffic

It seems impossible to know the reason of the traffic jams with out data or information that help to identify the reason That means it needs collecting data to identify the reason of traffic jam

## Solutions

### vehicles classification and counting

- Using surveillance cameras and using openCV library and python programing language to count and classify the vehicle
- By counting the vehicles we can know if the capacity of the road can handle this number or not
- And classify the vehicles to identify the trucks and cars because the size of the vehicle is effecting the capacity of the road

### Vehicles tracking

- Using surveillance cameras and using openCV library and python programing language to track the vehicle movement
- By tracking the movement of the vehicles we can identify the speed of the vehicle to predict the reason of the traffic jam
- Because unmoving object or under speed vehicle is causing the traffic jam

## Future work

- This project have a good potential to make the traffic monitoring and implementing autonomously
- By connoting the project with a simulated map for roads of the city
- And connect it with AI to control traffic lights to control the traffic more efficiently
